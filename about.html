                I started my professional career as a scientist. I did my PhD in materials science back in Spain (Tarragona). Afterwards, I moved to The Netherlands, where I did a postdoctoral research
            in light-reponsive materials at the TUe (Eindhoven).<br><br>During my whole life, I had passion for games. I enjoyed playing them as much as understanding them. From very little, I had
        great interest in how graphics were rendered on the screen. I used to build simple games/applications using C/C++ code and low-level libraries. Over the years, it became more than a hobby... but a time-consuming hobby.<br><br>I decided to give it a try. Even though, I love science and education. 
        I had to explore what it was to work in the game industry. Otherwise, my life as a game developer would have probably ended.<br><br> After a couple of years of 
    self-education and preparation. I got the chance to join the development team at Vertigo Games in Rotterdam.<br><br>And my life changed completely...<br><br>I have worked in the development of VR game titles like Arizona Sunshine 2 and After The Fall, but also in
    the development of VR applications for training communication (serious games).<br><br>During that time, I developed a custom game engine in C# as a learning project, which I consider one of the most valuable side-pojects I have worked on. At Vertigo Games, I could
    learn from extremely professional and competent programmers, while at home I could apply my knowledge on building the engine. It was a great period to bump up my skills and confidence in the software development world.<br><br>After that, I felt ready
    to start my onw commercial project... and that one is Tabletop Fantasy War. After one year and half of development, the game is ready and will be releasing very soon.<br><br>But, that is only the beginning... we are already working in our next annonounced project!</canvas> </p>
